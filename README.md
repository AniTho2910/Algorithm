# Algorithm
## Consist of some basic algorithms implemented in Java
- Quick Find
  (Interpretation:- Let p and q be two elements of array, they are connected iff they have same ID's
  
  Find:- Check if p and q have same ID
         id[p]==id[q], connected
         id[p]!=id[q], not connected
  
  Union:- To merge components containing p and q, change all entries whose ID equals id[p] into id[q])
